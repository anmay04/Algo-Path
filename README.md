Algo Path
Algo Path is a visualization tool for popular pathfinding algorithms. It provides an interactive interface where users can explore algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, and Greedy Best-First Search in action.

Features
Interactive Algorithm Selection: Choose from algorithms such as:
A* Search
Dijkstra
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Greedy Best-First Search
Dynamic Grid:
Visual representation of the source, destination, obstacles, explored nodes, unexplored nodes, and the resulting path.
Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility and aesthetics.
User Controls:
Start: Begin the pathfinding visualization.
Throw Obstacles: Randomly populate the grid with obstacles.
Clear: Reset the canvas to its initial state.
Demo

A quick demonstration of the Algo Path interface.

Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 4, Tailwind)
JavaScript (ES6+)
P5.js for dynamic sketching and grid rendering
GitHub Integration: Interactive GitHub star button and repository links.
